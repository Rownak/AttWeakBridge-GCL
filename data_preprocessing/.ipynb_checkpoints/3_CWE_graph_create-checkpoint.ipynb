If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.',\n",
       " 'Extended_Description': 'This can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or modifying important state information that should not be influenced by an outsider.A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:A race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single \"x++\" statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x).The interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.',\n",

       " 'Detection_Methods': \"Method Name: Black Box. Description: Black box methods may be able to identify evidence of race conditions via methods such as multiple simultaneous connections, which may cause the software to become instable or crash. However, race conditions with very narrow timing windows would not be detectable. Method Name: White Box. Description: Common idioms are detectable in white box analysis, such as time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) file operations (CWE-367), or double-checked locking (CWE-609). Method Name: Automated Dynamic Analysis. Description: This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Race conditions may be detected with a stress-test by calling the software simultaneously from a large number of threads or processes, and look for evidence of any unexpected behavior.Insert breakpoints or delays in between relevant code statements to artificially expand the race window so that it will be easier to detect.

       " 'Potential_Mitigations': 'Architecture and Design : In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.Architecture and Design : Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.Architecture and Design : Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring.\\n                  Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).Implementation : When using multithreading and operating on shared variables, only use thread-safe functions.Implementation : Use atomic operations on shared variables. Be wary of innocent-looking constructs such as \"x++\". This may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read, followed by a computation, followed by a write.Implementation : Use a mutex if available, but be sure to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-412.Implementation : Avoid double-checked locking (CWE-609) and other implementation errors that arise when trying to avoid the overhead of synchronization.Implementation : Disable interrupts or signals over critical parts of the code, but also make sure that the code does not go into a large or infinite loop.Implementation : Use the volatile type modifier for critical variables to avoid unexpected compiler optimization or reordering. This does not necessarily solve the synchronization problem, but it can help.Architecture and Design : Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76].

It takes the total amount of the transfer, sends it to the new account, and deducts the amount from the original account.. A race condition could occur between the calls to GetBalanceFromDatabase() and SendNewBalanceToDatabase().The following function attempts to acquire a lock in order to perform operations on a shared resource.. However, the code does not check the value returned by pthread_mutex_lock() for errors. If pthread_mutex_lock() cannot acquire the mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior.Suppose a processor\\'s Memory Management Unit (MMU) has 5 other shadow MMUs to distribute its workload for its various cores. Each MMU has the start address and end address of \"accessible\" memory. Any time this accessible range changes (as per the processor\\'s boot status), the main MMU sends an update message to all the shadow MMUs.. Suppose the interconnect fabric does not prioritize such \"update\" packets over other general traffic packets. This introduces a race condition. If an attacker can flood the target with enough messages so that some of those attack packets reach the target before the new access ranges gets updated, then the attacker can leverage this scenario.',\n",
