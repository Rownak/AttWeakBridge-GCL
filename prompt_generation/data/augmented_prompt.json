Insecure Temporary File.\nCreating and using insecure temporary files can leave application and system data vulnerable to attack. Unchecked Error Condition.\n[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER CWE-252, CWE-248, OR CWE-1069.] Ignoring exceptions and other error conditions may allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior unnoticed. Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory.\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory. Public Key Re-Use for Signing both Debug and Production Code.\nThe same public key is used for signing both debug and production code. Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password.\nThe product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak. Mutable Attestation or Measurement Reporting Data.\nThe register contents used for attestation or measurement reporting data to verify boot flow are modifiable by an adversary. Struts: Validator Turned Off.\nAutomatic filtering via a Struts bean has been turned off, which disables the Struts Validator and custom validation logic. This exposes the application to other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation. Excessive Use of Self-Modifying Code.\nThe product uses too much self-modifying\n\t\t\t\t\tcode. Semiconductor Defects in Hardware Logic with Security-Sensitive Implications.\nThe security-sensitive hardware module contains semiconductor defects."}
